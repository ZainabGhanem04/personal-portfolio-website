# personal-portfolio-website
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built as part of my final project for the Web Development 1 course with Paper Airplanes. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository is deployed via GitHub Pages, making the website accessible to everyone online.
