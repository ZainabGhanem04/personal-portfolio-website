Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This project was developed as part of my final project for the Web Development 1 course with Paper Airplanes. It serves as a professional showcase of my skills, experience, and projects, highlighting my journey into web development.  

--About the Project--
The portfolio is designed to present information in an organized, visually appealing, and user-friendly way. It features the following sections:  
- About Me: A brief introduction to who I am, my background, and interests.  
- Resume: A detailed overview of my degrees and programs.  
- Skills: A list of the tools and technologies I am proficient in.  
- Projects: A showcase of my work.  
- Contact Me: A list of links to enable visitors to get in touch.  

This website is not only a personal branding tool but also a reflection of my growth and learning in web development.  

--Features--
CSS Animations: 
I used CSS keyframes to add subtle animations, making the design more engaging and interactive. A special highlight is the "Contact Me" button, which twinkles on hover to draw attention.  

JavaScript Interactivity: JavaScript powers features like:   
- Smooth scrolling for better navigation.  
- A responsive toggle menu for smaller screens.  
- A synchronized twinkle effect for the "Contact Me" button.

GitHub Pages Deployment: 
The portfolio is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it accessible online for anyone to view.
