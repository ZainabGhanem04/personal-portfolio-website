Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This project was developed as part of my final project for the Web Development 1 course with Paper Airplanes. It serves as a professional showcase of my skills, experience, and projects, highlighting my journey into web development.  

About the Project: 
The portfolio is designed to present information in an organized, visually appealing, and user-friendly way. It features the following sections:  
- About Me: A brief introduction to who I am, my background, and interests.  
- Resume: A detailed overview of my degrees and programs.  
- Skills: A list of the tools and technologies I am proficient in.  
- Projects: A showcase of my work.  
- Contact Me: A list of links to enable visitors to get in touch.  

This website is not only a personal branding tool but also a reflection of my growth and learning in web development.  

Features: 

CSS Animations: 
I used CSS keyframes to add subtle animations, making the design more engaging and interactive. A special highlight is the "Contact Me" button, which twinkles on hover to draw attention.  

JavaScript Interactivity: JavaScript powers features like:   
- Smooth scrolling for better navigation.  
- A responsive toggle menu for smaller screens.  
- A synchronized twinkle effect for the "Contact Me" button.

GitHub Pages Deployment: 
The portfolio is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it accessible online for anyone to view.  

Challenges and Solutions:
This project was my first step into web development, and it came with its share of challenges:  
1. Overwhelming Resources: When I got to the point of applying what I learned during the internship, there were so many tutorials and guides available, it was hard to focus. I resolved this by narrowing my scope and following a small list of resources and inspirations projects built with tools I already understood.  
2. Design Iterations: I experimented with many designs, which took time but helped me learn about layouts and aesthetics.  
3. Limited Framework Knowledge: Most tutorials used frameworks beyond my level. Instead, I focused on mastering core web development concepts with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  


How to Access the Portfolio:
The portfolio is live and hosted on GitHub Pages. You can visit the website using this link: [https://github.com/ZainabGhanem04/personal-portfolio-website].  

Resources that inspired me and were very useful:
1- Freecodecamp youtube channel: there are so many courses and videos about web development.
2- w3schools: a great resource to learn the basics.
3- https://ziyadsk.github.io/portfolio-V2/ : a simple and beautiful portfolio website that inspired me.
